<br/>A notebook for running Julia 1.3.1 on Google Colab using the IJulia package.

## Prerequisites

A Google account, that's all.

## Using the Notebook

A step-by-step guide that tells you how to get the environment running:
1. Open the [Jupyter notebook](julia_on_collab.ipynb).
2. You can either download it or view it directly on Google Colab.
3. Run the first cell to install Julia and IJulia.

#### Note to the user

Since Google does not directly offer Julia-based computing you, have to take care:

- You need to **work from the same notebook** to get access to a Julia 1.3 kernel.
- You might lose connection to the host and, after re-connecting, you might lose your Julia packages that were installed. To tackle this situation, re-run the first cell and proceed with the follow up instructions in the notebook.
- If you want to create your own notebook, I suggest you use this as a base notebook to work from.
